Core:
- [ ] Rename `Domain` enum to `Axes`, `CoordSystem` or similar to avoid confusion when referring to volume covered by sampling `Grid` as a domain. This includes a major refactoring of `grid.py` and dependent modules.
- [ ] Enable `Grid` to represent a batch of sampling grids, or add `GridBatch` (cf. `Image` <-> `ImageBatch`).

Transforms:
- [ ] Basic data augmentations.

Examples:
- [ ] Implement traditional free-form deformation algorithm as an example.
- [ ] Implement Image-and-Spatial Transformer Networks as an example.
