Core:
- [ ] Enable `Grid` to represent a batch of sampling grids, or add `GridBatch` (cf. `Image` <-> `ImageBatch`).

Transforms:
- [ ] Basic data augmentations.

Examples:
- [ ] Implement traditional free-form deformation algorithm as an example.
- [ ] Implement Image-and-Spatial Transformer Networks as an example.

Tests:
- [ ] Full test coverage of core library functions.
- [ ] Tests of spatial transformation models.
- [ ] Tests for main data classes.
- [ ] Tests for datasets.
- [ ] Tests of loss terms.

Documentation:
- [ ] Add Sphinx based `docs`, see `docs/source/conf.py` of PyTorch or kornia.
