            If a sequence of values is given, these must be the strides for the different spatial
            dimensions in the order ``(sx, ...)``. A stride of 1 is equivalent to evaluating partial

    This function applies a non-rigid transformation to map a tensor of undeformed grid points to a

    the positions of undeformed spatial grid points, because this function uses interpolation to
    resize the vector fields to the size of the input ``grid``. This assumes that input points ``x``
    are the coordinates of points located on a regularly spaced undeformed grid which is aligned with
    the borders of the grid domain on which the vector fields of the non-rigid transformations are
    sampled, i.e., ``y = x + u``.

    the spatial transformation, use ``warp_points()`` instead.
